Category: SampleLongitude
R2 = 0.033 = 3% of the sums of squares can be explained by the Category.

null hypothesis: There is no significant difference between samples in Category, any observed difference being due to sampling or experimental error.
p-value = 0.45, more than 0.05, fail to reject null hypothesis
